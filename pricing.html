            Simple licensing, no subscriptions. Use the free trial to verify
            that DocForge works for your documents and your system before
            purchasing.

            <h2>Trial</h2>
            <p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
            <p>
              Full access to the app with batch limits (for example, up to 5
              files per batch). Intended for evaluation, testing, and light
              personal use.
            </p>
            <p>
              Trial mode may add subtle limitations, such as watermarks on
              exported documents. No account is required and there is no
              online activation.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you frequently hit the trial limits in your daily work, it's a
              strong signal that a paid license will save you time.

              Unlocks full batch conversion (no trial batch limit) and removes
              trial‑related limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Licensed for personal and commercial work by a single user. No
              online activation, no hardware locking; license information is
              stored locally.

              Your license key is delivered by the store where you purchase
              DocForge (for example, Gumroad). Keep it in a safe place in case
              you need to reinstall.

              Payments and applicable taxes are handled securely by our store

              DocForge is primarily developed and thoroughly tested on Windows
              10 and Windows 11 (64‑bit). macOS desktop builds share the same
              codebase and automated tests, but are currently verified on a
              smaller set of Mac devices.
            </p>
            <p>
              DocForge does not require an internet connection to install or
              use. Installation and all document conversion run fully offline
              on your machine.

            <p>
              DocForge is developed as a small indie project. The license
              includes all minor updates within the same major version (for
              example, all 1.x releases), plus bug fixes and improvements
              delivered on a best‑effort basis. There is no forced subscription
              and no automatic renewal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Purchasing a license directly supports continued maintenance and
              future development of DocForge.

            <p>
              DocForge provides a free trial so you can verify that it works for
              your documents and your system before purchasing a license.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because the full version runs entirely offline and cannot be
              "returned" in the traditional sense, we do not offer automatic
              no‑questions‑asked refunds for reasons such as "changed my mind"
              or "no longer needed", especially when the trial has not been
              used.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you encounter a technical issue that prevents you from using
              DocForge as advertised, please contact support within 14 days of
              purchase. We will first try to resolve the issue. If we cannot
              make the software work reasonably on your system, we will offer a
              refund on a case‑by‑case basis.
