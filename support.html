            DocForge is a small, privacy‑first desktop application maintained by
            an independent developer. We do our best to read every message, but
            we cannot guarantee instant responses or real‑time support.

              DocForge is not backed by a large company. We will read every
              email, but we may not be able to reply to all messages
              individually. Bug fixes and feature requests are handled on a
              best‑effort basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your issue is critical for your work, please mention this in
              the subject line of your email.
            </p>
            <p>
              We cannot offer guaranteed SLAs or 24/7 support, so please plan
              accordingly for time‑critical projects.
