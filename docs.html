            This guide walks you through installing DocForge, converting your first documents,
            understanding trial limits, and managing your license.

          <h2 class="section-title">Getting started</h2>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Download and install</h3>
            <p>
              Download the latest version of DocForge from the official download page linked on the
              home page. Choose the installer that matches your platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
            </p>
            <p>
              After installing, launch DocForge from your desktop or applications menu. The main
              window opens with three key areas: the file list, conversion options, and logs.

            <div class="card">
              <h3>Convert a single document</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Add a Markdown, HTML, TXT, or DOCX file to the list.</li>
                <li>Choose an output format such as PDF or DOCX.</li>
                <li>Click the convert button to generate the output document.</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h3>Batch conversion</h3>
              <p>
                Add multiple files or folders to the batch list. DocForge will convert all supported
                files in one run using your current settings. In trial mode, batch size is limited
                so you can evaluate the workflow without enabling large-scale free usage.
              </p>

              <h3>Previewing output</h3>
              <p>
                Use the Preview tab to see an approximate HTML preview of the output before running
                a full conversion. This helps you catch obvious layout issues early.

            <div class="card">
              <h3>Choosing a preset</h3>
              <p>
                Select a preset that matches your use case, such as technical, academic, or
                writer-oriented layouts. Presets bundle sensible defaults for fonts, spacing, and
                page headers.

            <div class="card">
              <h3>Adjusting typography</h3>
              <p>
                You can fine-tune font size, margins, and line spacing for PDF and DOCX outputs.
                For most users, the defaults are a good starting point; adjust only if you have
                specific formatting requirements.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h3>Headers &amp; footers</h3>
              <p>
                Enable headers and footers when you need document titles, file names, or page
                numbers on every page. Reusable placeholders help you keep layouts consistent
                across many documents.

          <h2 class="section-title">Trial limits &amp; licensing</h2>
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              DocForge offers a free trial so you can verify that it works for your documents and
              your system. Trial mode keeps all core features available but may limit batch size and
              apply subtle trial-related restrictions.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you are ready to unlock full batch conversion and remove trial limitations, you
              can purchase a license key from the official store. After purchase, enter your
              license key in the app under the license menu to switch out of trial mode.

          <h2 class="section-title">Platform notes</h2>
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              DocForge is primarily developed and deeply tested on Windows 10 and Windows 11
              (64-bit). macOS desktop builds share the same codebase and automated tests, but are
              currently verified on a smaller set of physical Mac devices. macOS-specific issues
              may occasionally appear and may take a bit longer to diagnose and fix.
            </p>
            <p>
              On Linux, DocForge is typically used by more technical users via the command-line
              interface or HTTP API. If you run into platform-specific issues, please contact
              support so we can triage and improve future releases.

          <h2 class="section-title">FAQ &amp; troubleshooting</h2>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Installation problems</h3>
            <p>
              If the installer fails or the app will not start, first make sure you downloaded the
              latest version from the official website. Antivirus software or corporate policies may
              occasionally block desktop installers; adding an exception or consulting your IT team
              can help in those environments.
            </p>
            <h3>Conversion issues</h3>
            <p>
              If a particular document does not convert as expected, try a smaller test file first
              and review the Logs tab for details. When contacting support, including a simplified
              sample file (without confidential data) often speeds up troubleshooting.
            </p>
            <h3>Getting help</h3>
            <p>
              For detailed support instructions and contact details, see the Support page on this
              site. Please include your operating system, DocForge version, and a short description
              of what you were trying to do.
